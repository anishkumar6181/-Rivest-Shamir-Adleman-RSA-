# Overview
RSA is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.

It was developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
# Features
Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys – a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Security: Relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, ensuring strong security.

Versatility: Can be used for both encryption and digital signatures, providing data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
# How It Works
Key Generation: Involves generating two large prime numbers and using them to produce the public and private keys.

Encryption: Data is encrypted with the recipient’s public key, ensuring only the recipient can decrypt it with their private key.

Decryption: The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the data, recovering the original message.
# Advantages
Strong Security: Resistant to brute-force attacks due to the complexity of factoring large numbers.

No Shared Secret: Eliminates the need to share secret keys, reducing the risk of key compromise.
# Conclusion
RSA remains a fundamental technology in the field of cryptography, providing robust security for digital communications and data protection.
