# Overview
RSA is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.
It was developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

# Features
Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys – a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Security: Relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, ensuring strong security.
Versatility: Can be used for both encryption and digital signatures, providing data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

# How It Works
Key Generation: Involves generating two large prime numbers and using them to produce the public and private keys.
Encryption: Data is encrypted with the recipient’s public key, ensuring only the recipient can decrypt it with their private key.
Decryption: The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the data, recovering the original message.
